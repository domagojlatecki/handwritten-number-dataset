# Handwritten Number Dataset
This repository contains a collection of handwritten numbers from 33 different handwrittings. Each handwriting is
inside a single directory named `set-*` which contains two subdirectories: `test` and `train`. The label for each
image is available as the first 10 characters of the name of the image.
